think about it i can make it much simplre, i can make it

I have been stuck on which tech stack to use.

If i look at both languages I need to consider what advantages and 
disadavatages they have.
when i look at javascript, it will allow me to create A progressive 
web app, in its benefits will allow me to access certain things 
with regards to the phone. for example GPS location. Blutooth 
enalling.

What I can do is start by creating scripts that i can turn into modules

about the system.

1.API script.
